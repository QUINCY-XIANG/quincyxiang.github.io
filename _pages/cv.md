• My project aims to identify the advantages of specific products based on customer reviews and
ratings from online platforms such as Amazon.
• Leveraging dependency parsing and sentiment analysis techniques like VADER to extract key
advantage-related information from preprocessed text.
• Applying Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to classify and group the extracted advan-
tage pairs into distinct topics, providing a structured analysis of product strengths

FIELDS OF INTEREST
======
Mathematical applications in Interdisciplinary fields :
• Having a strong interest in the applications of mathematics within Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning, particularly in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
• Especially interested in exploring methods for processing and interpreting homophonic phe-
nomena in the Chinese language, a challenge that frequently arises in online reviews on Chi-
nese social media. This phenomenon is especially relevant for detecting and mitigating harm-
ful or obscene content, making it a crucial aspect of sentiment analysis and content modera-
tion.
