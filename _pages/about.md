I'm a second year undergraduate student from [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/), [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes pure math problems in Algebra and intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, with a particular focus on natural language processing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ferdinand Ihringer](https://math.ihringer.org/) from Department of Mathematics, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).
